# Chapter 12: Scheduling Tasks

To schedule tasks, you can use:
- **systemd timer**: default solution to ensure specific tasks are started at specific times
- **cron**: legacy scheduler service; still supported and responsible for scheduling a few services
- **st**: used to schedule an occasional user job for future execution
