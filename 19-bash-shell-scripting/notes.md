# Chapter 19: Intro to Bash Shell Scripting

A **shell script** is a list of commands sequentially executed. 

**shebang: #/bin/bash** defines the script as a bash shell script. 

Add comments under the shebang to say what the script does. As it gets more complex, add commentd to the subsections. 

**exit 0** is used at the end of the script to terminate it and indicates that it's successfully completed to the parent shell. Itâ€™s not necessary to use for simple shell scrpts, but it's good practice. 

`chmod +x scriptname` adds execute permissionto the script to make it executable. You can also do `bash scriptname` to run a script without changing permissions. 

`./scriptname` runs the script. 

`clear` clears terminal screen before executing the rest of the script. 

The first argument of a script is $1, second is $2, and so on. 

$# - a counter that shows how many arguments were used when starting a script. 

$@ - refers to all arguments that were used when starting a script. 

**for loops**
- commands are executed as long as the condition is true
- the body of a for loop starts with **do** and is closed with **done**

**variable**
- label that refers to a specific value 
- can be defined statically like NAME=ella
- can be defined dynamically 2 ways:
    - using **read** to ask the user for input
    - use a command to assign the output to the value 

If loops - if, then, else, fi, elif
- **fi** is used to end the loop
- if an argument is true, commands after **then** are executed
- can use semicolon as separater instead of going on new line
- commonly used with the `test` commmand 

`test` checks file types and values. It can be used as an expression ([...]). *Ex:* `test -z $1` id the same as `[-z $1]`. 

Conditional loops

- if...then...else: used to execute code if a specific condition is true

- for: used to execute commands for a range of values 

- while: used to execute code as long as (while) a specific condition is true. Useful for monitoring the availability of a process - monitor it while its working

- until: used to execute code until a specific condition is true

- case: used to evaluate specific values, like a switch case. Close with **esac**. 

** `bash -x script.sh` use to debug a script. It shows line by line what the script is trying to do. Shows specific errors.

### Do you already know? Questions

1. Every bash script should start with the shebang - **#!/bin/bash**. 

2. The purpose of **exit 0** used at the end of a script is to inform the parent shell that the script executed without any problems. 

3. To pause a script to allow a user to provide input, use **read**. 

4. Given the variable NAME, the first argument is stored in the line `NAME=$1`. 

5. To refer to all arguments thatvwere provided, use **$@**. **$*** also refers to all arguments, but groups them together as one entity. 

6. To close an if loop, use **fi**. 

7. If there is a nested if loop condition, it is started with **elif**. 

8. Within a for loop, use **do** to start the commands when the condition is true. 

9. To send a msg with the subject "error" to the root user, if something didn't work in a script, use `mail -s error root < .`. **-s** option specifies subject. **< .** is STDIN redirection. 

10. To refer to all options not specified in the script inside a case statement, use ** *)**. 


### Review Questions

1. If the script doesn't start with a **shebang**, it will be interpreted by the same shell as the parent shell. If you want to run it as a bash script, you need to add the shebang. 

2. To check if the variable VAR has no value, use `test -z $VAR` or `[-z $VAR]`. 

3. Use `$#` to count the number of arguments that have been used. 

4. Use `$@` to refer to all arguments that have been used. 

5. To process user input, use `read VARIABLE`. 

6. To test if a file exists and output an echo if it doesn't, use `[-f filename] || echo file doesn't exist`. 

7. To determine if something is a file or directory, use `[-e name]`. 

8. A **for loop** is used to evaluate a range of items. 

9. An `elif` statement is part of an if statement, which ends with `fi`. 

10. In a case statement, you have to use **;;** to close a specific item.
