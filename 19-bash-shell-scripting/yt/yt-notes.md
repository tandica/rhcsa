# Bash Shell Scripting

**shebang** - a line at the top of the script that tells the OS what kind of interpretor it should run on

### Conditionally execute code (use of: if, test, [], etc.)

Basic syntax:

```bash
if []
then
# commands
fi
```

### Use Looping constructs (for, etc.) to process file, command line input


### Process script inputs ($1, $2, etc.)

Arguments are defined as **$1** - **$9**. It doesn't go past 9. 

**$@** refers to all of the arguments. 

**$#** is the total number of arguments.  

Take the output of a command:

`DIRLIST=$(ls -l ~)`

Donâ€™t use hyphen/dash in variable names ??

Exit code processing: programs return an exit code that indicates if it was successful or not. 

**Exit code 0** indicates success. Other codes inidcate some type of failure. 

You can check an exit code with `echo $?`. 

The `exit` command at the end of the script causes it to end and return an exit code. *Ex:* `exit 0`.
